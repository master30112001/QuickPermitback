## Description :
The motive behind our project is to have a hassle-free system to seek permissions from college to simplify the otherwise cumbersome process observed.
The idea is to send and approve/reject permission requests for conducting events/sessions in college on one single platform.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 types of users - Student, Teacher, Admin <br/> <br/>
•  <b> Student </b>- <br/>
Students have the option to join clubs and send Permission Forms for conducting events/sessions in college as well as sending Leave Forms to specific teachers. <br/><br/>
• <b>Teacher </b>- <br/>
Teachers can approve/reject permission requests of clubs they coordinate. <br/><br/>
• <b> Admin </b>-<br/>
Admin has all the powers - They can Schedule an event, Create a new club, Create a new event, Add users to the platform and many more. You can say that the Admin gets an overview of the entire system.  <br/>

## Features :
1. Calendar - Whenever an event is approved, the system automatically creates an event in the Calendar of website. Advantage? Before creating an event you can check if any other club has an event during that time in the college
2. Excel - Now say the Admin wants to add 100s of users. Will he add them manually? Hold on! We got a solution. Just upload an excel sheet with all the required data of the user, our website will parse the data and create users for you
3. Approve users before letting them in - Are you afraid of fake users in your portal? Again.. We have got a solution, each users needs to be approved by the Admin before after registering their account on the website. Admin will verify whether the user is a genuine user and approve his account for the portal or else he can even deny access by rejecting his account. As I said, Admin is the superpower here ;)
4. Analysis - My portal has 2000+ users !!! How can I identify who all are in this particular club? How can I know from 2000 users who all are teacher heads of this club? Solution - We have got a tab where you can check who all are teachers of the club, who are authority users, who are student members, which events the club has conducted so far, when was it conducted... and many more all in one section at a single glance
